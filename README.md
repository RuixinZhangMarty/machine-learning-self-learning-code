# machine-learning-self-learning-code
I am learning machine learning all by myself. And I really want to record every machine-learning algorithm I have learned by uploading my self-made python code for each algorithm. Hopefully I can enjoy myself through the study and help myself achieve the goal of becoming a great data scientist!
